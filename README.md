# Money Manager site

The public pages for the Money Manager app, served by GitHub Pages at
https://pedrojfs17.github.io/money-manager-app/.

- `index.html`: the landing page.
- `privacy.html`: the privacy policy, also linked from the Google OAuth consent screen.
- `bank-redirect/`: the Enable Banking redirect URL.

## Bank redirect

After a bank login, Enable Banking sends the browser to `bank-redirect/`. The page forwards only `code`, `state`,
`error` and `error_description` to the app (`moneymanager://bank/callback`) and sends nothing anywhere else. The code
is useless without the private key that stays on the person's phone.

Register this URL in your Enable Banking application:
